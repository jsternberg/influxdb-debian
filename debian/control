Description: Flexible and high performance time series database in the TICK stack
 InfluxDB is a time series database built from the ground up to handle high
 write and query loads. It is the second piece of the TICK stack. InfluxDB is
 meant to be used as a backing store for any use case involving large amounts
 of timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT
 sensor data, and real-time analytics.
